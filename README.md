# KUFID

![KUFID badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kufid/kufid/main/badge-not-uuid.svg)


**Kinda Unnecessary Funny Identifier**  
_A completely unnecessary alternative to UUIDs — and proud of it._

🚧 This project is under construction.  
📦 `npm install kufid` → coming soon  
We're working on something uselessly delightful.

## 🤔 What's KUFID?

KUFID is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that generates **human-readable**, **word-based**, and **number-free** identifiers.  
Because cryptic strings like `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479` are great for machines...  
…but maybe your brain prefers `fluffy-pancake` instead 🥞

KUFIDs are not globally unique, not ISO-compliant, and definitely not serious.  
They’re just fun little word combos that make dev logs more… readable.

## 💬 Why does KUFID exist?

Because UUIDs are:
- Long
- Cold
- Unpronounceable

…and because sometimes you want an ID like `angry-goose` in your console.

### 🧏 How do you pronounce “KUFID”?

Nobody agrees. Some say **“KOO-fid”** (rhymes with “lucid”), others insist on **“KEU-fid”** (like a Québécois cousin of “Cupid”). There are also reports of developers mumbling **“cue-FEED”** under their breath while staring at logs, and one brave soul in Helsinki pronounces it **“K’yooph-yeed”** — we don’t ask why.

It has no official pronunciation.  
It never will.  
The only correct way is with confidence.

> Say it like you mean it — even if you're making it up.
